README
Mike, if you can read this...well, ROCK ON!!!  If not, then its back to the drawing board for me and the Readme.  
This is the project I did a few days ago.  Made the mistake of burying my project about 10 file layers deep. 
Not what you want when you have to type it all out!  Lesson learned. 
Not sure what to do next.  I'll talk to you Friday.  Take care bro and Thanks, E.
